    <h2>How to Make Chili</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full, detailed recipe below, but here's what you can expect when making this chili:</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Sauté the Vegetables</h3>
    <p>In a large pot, sauté the onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeños, and garlic until softened.</p>
    <h3>Brown the Ground Beef</h3>
    <p>Brown the ground beef, then season it with Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, bouillon, and beer. Once combined, add the beef mixture to the vegetable mixture.</p>
    <h3>Add the Tomato Products and Seasonings</h3>
    <p>Stir crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, and seasonings into the beef and vegetable mixture.</p>
    <h3>Simmer</h3>
    <p>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer until the flavors have blended together, about 90 minutes. Add in kidney beans, then simmer for another 30 minutes, until the beans are hot.</p>
    <h3>Make the Crema</h3>
    <p>In a blender, combine sour cream, cilantro, and cumin to create a crema. Serve the chili topped with crema and any other toppings you like.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How to Thicken Chili</h2>
    <p>This chili should already be your preferred level of thickness, thanks to all the thickening agents in it. But if you're having trouble reaching your desired consistency, there are multiple ways to thicken chili.
        <br><br>
        The easiest way is to simply simmer it for longer. The longer it simmers, the more liquid will evaporate.
        <br><br>
        But, if you don't have time to simmer your chili for hours, you can thicken it with cornmeal, cornstarch, or all-purpose flour. Add 1 tablespoon of cornmeal directly to the pot and allow it to simmer for about 10 more minutes to thicken up. Or add a cornstarch or flour slurry — this means 1 tablespoon of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or 2 tablespoons of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of flour. If you add flour or cornstarch directly to the chili, it will clump. Instead, gradually whisk in the slurry then simmer for 10 minutes.
        <br><br>
        Another option is to add more starchy ingredients, like vegetables or beans. These will absorb some of the liquids and thicken the chili. Plus, you'll have more hearty and delicious ingredients to enjoy.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What to Serve With Chili</h2>
        <p>Chili is filling enough to stand-alone as a full meal itself, but you can always add sides or even use chili as a "topping" for other foods.
            <br><br>
            Try serving it with cornbread, coleslaw, or grilled corn. For more inspiration check out our best side dishes to serve with chili.
