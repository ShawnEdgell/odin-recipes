    <h1>Soup</h1>
    <p>This incredible lasagna soup tastes exactly like a really good lasagna, but is a very rich, very meaty tomato soup. The little bit of extra work you'll do—precooking the noodles, then baking them in the oven—is absolutely worth the time and effort. The buttery, baked, and toasted noodles that are then added to the soup make this absolutely phenomenal.</p>
    <h2>Soup Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Noodles:</h3>
        <li>8 ounces dry lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <h3>Soup Base:</h3>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in lasagna noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until just flexible, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer noodles into cold water until cooled; drain very well.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and grease parchment with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
      <li>Cut noodles in half lengthwise. Arrange noodles in evenly overlapping rows on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with melted butter, and use fingers to rub some butter between the noodles.</li>
      <li>Bake noodles in the preheated oven until they are golden, blistered, and are beginning to brown with crispy outside edges. Let cool; cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
      <li>Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a soup pot, and place over high heat. Add beef and sausage. Use a spatula to break up the meat into small pieces; cook without stirring until liquid evaporates and meat begins to sizzle in its own fat, then continue to cook and stir until meat begins to brown, about 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add onions, garlic, tomato paste, red pepper flakes, dried oregano, black pepper, and kosher salt. Cook and stir until onions begin to turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
